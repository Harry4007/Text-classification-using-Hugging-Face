# Text-classification-using-Hugging-Face
In this model We have build a Text classification using NLP using Hugging Face model.


## Brief Overview of model and Dataset
The task is to build an NLP model using Hugging Face and Transformers on a tweet
dataset with two columns - text and label. The text column contains comments from
users, while the label column contains the corresponding emotion of the comment. The
goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify the emotion of a given tweet
based on its text content.

To achieve this, we can use the Hugging Face library to tokenize and preprocess the text
data, and then use a pre-trained transformer model like DistilBERT to train a
classification model on the dataset. The dataset can be split into training and testing
data to evaluate the performance of the model using metrics like accuracy, precision,
recall, and F1 score. A classification report can be generated to further analyze the
performance of the model on the testing data.

Overall, the goal is to develop a robust and accurate NLP model that can classify the
emotions of tweets based on their text content, which could have applications in
sentiment analysis, customer feedback analysis, and social media monitoring.

To build an NLP model using Hugging Face and Transformers on a tweet dataset with
two columns - text and label, we can follow these steps:

### Preprocessing:
● Clean the text by removing unwanted characters, HTML tags, and URLs.

● Tokenize the text by splitting it into words and converting them into numerical
tokens.

● Pad and truncate the input sequences to ensure they have the same length.

● Convert the categorical emotion labels into numerical values.

### Model Architecture:
● Use the DistilBERT model from Hugging Face, a smaller and faster variant of the
popular BERT model.

● Fine-tune the DistilBERT model on the tweet dataset using transfer learning.

● The model architecture consists of an input layer, multiple transformer blocks,
and a dense output layer with softmax activation for multi-class classification.

### Fine-tuning the model:
● Use the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function to fine-tune
the model.

● Train the model for several epochs, gradually decreasing the learning rate over
time to improve convergence.

● Evaluate the model on a separate validation set during training to monitor the
performance and prevent overfitting.

### Evaluation:
● Use accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score as evaluation metrics.

● The model achieved an overall accuracy of 0.85 on the testing dataset, indicating
good performance.

● Calculate precision, recall, and F1 score for each emotion class to analyze the
model's performance in individual classes.

### Possible Improvements:
● Increase the size of the training dataset or fine-tune the model on a larger
dataset.

● Experiment with different hyperparameters or use different pre-trained models to
potentially improve performance.

### Sample Predictions:
● Pass a new text to the model to generate a predicted emotion label.

● Interpret the model's decisions and understand its reasoning using attention
scores.
